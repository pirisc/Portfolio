**Dog Breed Classifier**


**Overview**

The Dog Breed Classifier is a deep learning model built with PyTorch that classifies dog breeds from a dataset containing over 10,000 labeled images across 120 different breeds. This project aims to demonstrate the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks, specifically for identifying dog breeds.

The model is deployed via Gradio and hosted on Hugging Face, providing users with an interactive interface to classify dog breeds in real-time by simply uploading an image.
